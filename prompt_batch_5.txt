I will give you a list of numbered news summaries. Your task is to analyze each summary's likely short-term impact on three Turkish assets: USD/TRY (Dolar), Gold (Altın), and BIST 100 (Borsa).

Rating Scale:
- For USD/TRY (Dolar): A positive score means Lira strengthens (dollar falls). 1 = very negative (dollar soars), 3 = neutral, 5 = very positive (dollar drops).
- For Gold (Altın) and Stock Market (Borsa): A positive score means the asset's value increases. 1 = very negative (price falls), 3 = neutral, 5 = very positive (price rises).

For each number, you MUST respond with ONLY a valid JSON object in the format {"dolar": <score>, "altin": <score>, "borsa": <score>}. Do not add any other text or numbering. Start with the response for number 1, then a new line for number 2, and so on.
